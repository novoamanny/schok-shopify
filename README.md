# Schok (Modified North Theme)
Custom Shopify theme based on the North theme

## Pushing updates to the theme
`theme watch`

The theme watch command instructs Theme Kit to watch for any changes made to your local files, and automatically pushes changes to your theme in the connected Shopify store. To close the watch connection, type ctrl + c.
After changes are made the theme will automatically update the preview but you will still need to push changes to GIT as you normally would.
